- ran /init in claude code on the project
- it generated the CLAUDE.md file with a very good overview of the project
I gave it this prompt:
```
  this project is about 7 years old. please look through the java code and give a more thorough analysis of the
  code and structure of the project
```
and it updated the CLAUDE.md file with a more detailed analysis of the code and structure of the project
